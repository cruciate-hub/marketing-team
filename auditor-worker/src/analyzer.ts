## Brand Guidelines

${guidelines}

## Your Task

Analyze the provided content against the brand guidelines above. Be thorough, specific, and actionable.

${modeInstructions}

## Scoring Dimensions (each 0-100)

- **Terminology**: Are approved terms used consistently? Are forbidden terms absent? Scan for EVERY approved and forbidden term listed in the terminology guidelines and report found/count for each one.
- **Tone**: Does it match the brand voice? Active voice, no emojis, no em dashes, no hype language, confidence through clarity, structured paragraphs, no rhetorical fluff.
- **Hierarchy**: Does messaging follow the prescribed order? Context/market shift first, then infrastructure positioning, then engagement, then intelligence/analytics, then revenue/monetization, then long-term compounding advantage. Revenue must NEVER lead.
- **Claims**: Are all claims verifiable? No invented statistics, no guaranteed outcomes ("guaranteed growth/retention/revenue"), no fabricated customer references, no features not documented in official product docs.
- **Positioning**: Is social.plus framed as "infrastructure" (not a tool, not a social network, not a forum)? Is "platform" used only as a secondary/supporting term, never the primary descriptor?

## Severity Definitions

- **critical**: Direct violation of a mandatory rule. Wrong terminology, forbidden terms used, messaging hierarchy violated, unverifiable claims, positioning as tool/network/forum.
- **warning**: Significant departure from guidelines that weakens the message. Missing key terms, suboptimal positioning, revenue language too prominent, generic/weak CTAs.
- **suggestion**: Improvement opportunity. Typos, missing context, strengthening opportunities, dead links, minor style issues.

## Output Requirements

Respond with ONLY valid JSON matching this exact schema. No markdown code fences, no explanation outside the JSON:

${OUTPUT_SCHEMA}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Every finding MUST include the exact "original" text from the content and a concrete "revised" replacement.
2. The "docRef" must name the actual guideline section being referenced.
3. overallScore = weighted average: Terminology 25%, Tone 20%, Hierarchy 20%, Claims 15%, Positioning 20%.
4. Scan for ALL approved and forbidden terms from the terminology guidelines — report every single one with found status and count.
5. Be specific — quote exact phrases from the content, don't be vague.
6. Only report genuine issues. Do not invent problems that don't exist in the content.
7. Sort findings by severity: critical first, then warning, then suggestion.`;

The terms scan must be exhaustive — check every single approved and forbidden term listed in the guidelines.`;

Focus exclusively on messaging hierarchy and narrative structure. Check if the content follows the prescribed messaging order.
For dimensions that are not hierarchy, assign a neutral score of 75 and report no findings for those categories.`;

A CPO cares about product-market fit, positioning clarity, and user experience messaging.
A CTO cares about technical accuracy, integration claims, and infrastructure positioning.
A Developer cares about SDK/API references, technical terminology, and getting-started clarity.
All five dimensions should be scored and analyzed, but findings should be framed through the persona lens.`;
