Reference files live in the public `cruciate-hub/marketing-team` GitHub repo. Fetch them by shallow-cloning the repo once per session, then loading individual files with `cat`. Use this exact pattern at the start of every skill that needs reference files:

    REPO="${MT_REPO:-/tmp/cruciate-hub-marketing-team}"
    if [ ! -d "$REPO/.git" ]; then
      git clone --depth 1 --quiet https://github.com/cruciate-hub/marketing-team.git "$REPO"
    else
      git -C "$REPO" pull --ff-only --quiet
    fi

After the clone exists, read files with `cat "$REPO/<path>"`. Examples: `cat "$REPO/brain.md"`, `cat "$REPO/messaging/terminology.md"`.

The Bash tool truncates large stdout to a small preview when the output exceeds the harness's display cap (the exact size varies by environment — observed in the 20–50 KB range). When that happens you'll see a marker like `Output too large (NkB). Full output saved to: …` followed by a short preview, and the rest is invisible to you in-call. Most files in this repo are small enough that `cat` returns them in full and you never see the marker. **If you do see the marker, never proceed using the preview as if it were the whole file** — switch to one of the patterns below.

- **Truncated markdown** — read in line-range chunks instead. First check the total line count: `wc -l "$REPO/<path>"`. Then read each chunk:

      sed -n '1,250p'     "$REPO/<path>"
      sed -n '251,500p'   "$REPO/<path>"
      sed -n '501,$p'     "$REPO/<path>"

  Each ~250-line chunk fits under the preview cap. Concatenate the chunks mentally. For files much larger than 750 lines, add more chunks at 250-line intervals until you reach the total.

  **If a chunk itself comes back as a truncated preview** (output above the harness's display cap — visible as an "Output too large" or similar marker, with the rest spilled to a file you can't see in-call), halve the chunk size and retry. For example, swap `sed -n '1,250p'` for `sed -n '1,125p'` then `sed -n '126,250p'`. Repeat until each chunk lands in full. Never proceed using a truncated chunk as if it were complete.

- **Large JSON inventories** (`website/pages-*.json`, up to 228 KB) — never `cat` raw. Process with `python3` or `jq` and emit only the fields you need:

      python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('$REPO/website/pages-blog.json')); print(len(d['pages']))"
      jq '.pages[].url' "$REPO/website/pages-blog.json"

  Skill helper scripts (e.g. `scripts/duplicate_check.py`) already follow this pattern.

Note: Claude Code's `Read` tool can't reach files in `$REPO` — Cowork sandboxes Read to connected directories and `/tmp` is not connected by default. Use the `cat` / `sed` / `python` patterns above.

Validate every file before using it:
- Markdown: content must start with `#`
- JSON: content must start with `{` or `[`
- HTML: content must start with `<`
- Content must be non-empty

If anything fails — clone error, missing file, empty content, or wrong format:
- Do NOT reconstruct from memory or training data.
- Do NOT fall back to WebFetch or any other tool.
- Stop immediately and respond with exactly this line:

  `Fetch failed: <path>. Please check your network connection and rerun.`
