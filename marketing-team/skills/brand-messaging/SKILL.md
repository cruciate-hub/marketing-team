  NOT for blog posts — blog-seo-content is the only skill for
  social.plus/blog posts, regardless of topic (product or general).

  This skill writes non-blog marketing content: feature pages, landing
  pages, homepage copy, product descriptions, Webflow CMS release-note
  items, taglines, pitch materials, investor copy, and brand voice audits.

  Also not for: press releases (press-release); customer stories
  (case-study); AEO /answers/ content (aeo-content); emails (newsletters);
  legal documents (legal-docs-formatter).
when_to_use: >
  NOT for: "blog post", "article for the blog", "blog about [feature]",
  "write a blog". NOT for gap analysis — "does the website reflect this
  update" or "what's missing from the site" belong to product-update-vs-
  website. Trigger phrases: "write a feature page", "homepage copy",
  "landing page for X", "release note for [feature]", "tagline",
  "pitch copy", "review this copy for brand voice", "product update",
  "write a product update", "monthly product update", "what's new page",
  "what's new in social.plus", "new feature announcement", "feature
  announcement", "put this update on the website", "write this up for the
  site", "turn this changelog into website copy".

# social.plus Brand Messaging

This skill ensures all social.plus content aligns with official brand messaging. The source of truth lives on GitHub and must be fetched fresh every time.

## How to fetch reference files

<!-- FETCH-BLOCK:START v2 -->
Reference files live in the public `cruciate-hub/marketing-team` GitHub repo. Fetch them by shallow-cloning the repo once per session, then loading individual files with `cat`. Use this exact pattern at the start of every skill that needs reference files:

    REPO="${MT_REPO:-/tmp/cruciate-hub-marketing-team}"
    REMOTE="https://github.com/cruciate-hub/marketing-team.git"
    # Create the clone only when the path is absent. Never delete an existing
    # directory: it may be a working checkout holding un-pushed local commits.
    if [ ! -e "$REPO" ]; then
      git clone --depth 1 --quiet "$REMOTE" "$REPO" || true
    elif git -C "$REPO" rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      # Refresh, but do NOT ignore a failed pull. Silently serving stale
      # content is the exact bug this block exists to prevent.
      git -C "$REPO" pull --ff-only --quiet 2>/dev/null \
        || echo "Note: could not refresh $REPO; verifying existing content below." >&2
    fi
    # Mechanical integrity gate. Do not skip. Probes core files across several
    # top-level dirs so a missing, corrupt, or partial clone stops the skill
    # here instead of letting it read incomplete content and draw wrong conclusions.
    miss=""
    for f in brain.md messaging/brain.md messaging/terminology.md messaging/tone.md design-system/brain.md; do
      [ -s "$REPO/$f" ] || miss="$miss $f"
    done
    if ! git -C "$REPO" rev-parse HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1 || [ -n "$miss" ]; then
      echo "Fetch failed: clone at $REPO is unreachable or incomplete.${miss:+ Absent files:$miss}" >&2
      echo "Check your network. If the clone is corrupt and holds no local work, run  rm -rf \"$REPO\"  then re-run." >&2
      echo "(If \$MT_REPO points at your own checkout, rescue its changes first; this never auto-deletes it.)" >&2
      exit 1
    fi

After the clone exists, read files with `cat "$REPO/<path>"`. Examples: `cat "$REPO/brain.md"`, `cat "$REPO/messaging/terminology.md"`.

The integrity gate above fails loud rather than serving partial content, and it never deletes `$REPO` (it can hold un-pushed local work). To make skills read your own local edits, point `MT_REPO` at your working checkout before running them.

The Bash tool truncates large stdout when the output exceeds the harness's token/byte cap (observed at ~50 KB in Cowork; varies by environment). When this happens the harness emits one of these signals — both mean the same thing:
- `Output too large (NkB). Full output saved to: …` followed by a short preview, OR
- `Error: result (N characters) exceeds maximum allowed tokens` with no preview, just a sidecar-file pointer.

In either case, the rest of the file is invisible to you in-call. Most files in this repo are small enough that `cat` returns them in full and you never see either signal. **If you do see either form, never proceed using the partial output as if it were the whole file** — switch to one of the patterns below.

- **Truncated markdown** (you saw either truncation signal above) — read in line-range chunks instead. First check the total line count: `wc -l "$REPO/<path>"`. Then read each chunk:

      sed -n '1,250p'     "$REPO/<path>"
      sed -n '251,500p'   "$REPO/<path>"
      sed -n '501,$p'     "$REPO/<path>"

  Each ~250-line chunk fits under the preview cap. Concatenate the chunks mentally. For files much larger than 750 lines, add more chunks at 250-line intervals until you reach the total.

  **If a chunk itself comes back as a truncated preview** (output above the harness's display cap — visible as an "Output too large" or similar marker, with the rest spilled to a file you can't see in-call), halve the chunk size and retry. For example, swap `sed -n '1,250p'` for `sed -n '1,125p'` then `sed -n '126,250p'`. Repeat until each chunk lands in full. Never proceed using a truncated chunk as if it were complete.

- **Large JSON inventories** (`website/pages-*.json`, up to 228 KB) — never `cat` raw. Process with `python3` or `jq` and emit only the fields you need:

      python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('$REPO/website/pages-blog.json')); print(len(d['pages']))"
      jq '.pages[].url' "$REPO/website/pages-blog.json"

  Skill helper scripts (e.g. `scripts/duplicate_check.py`) already follow this pattern.

Note: Claude Code's `Read` tool can't reach files in `$REPO` — Cowork sandboxes Read to connected directories and `/tmp` is not connected by default. Use the `cat` / `sed` / `python` patterns above.

Validate every file before using it:
- Markdown: content must start with `#`
- JSON: content must start with `{` or `[`
- HTML: content must start with `<`
- Content must be non-empty

If anything fails — clone error, missing file, empty content, or wrong format:
- Do NOT reconstruct from memory or training data.
- Do NOT fall back to WebFetch or any other tool.
- Stop immediately and respond with exactly this line:

  `Fetch failed: <path>. Please check your network connection and rerun.`

## What to do

1. Fetch `brain.md` for cross-domain routing, precedence rules, and the compliance check.

2. Fetch `messaging/brain.md` (the messaging router).

3. Follow the messaging router's instructions — it tells you which additional files to fetch based on the user's task.

4. If the output includes any visual styling (HTML, CSS, colors, layout), also fetch `design-system/brain.md`.

5. Before delivering, run the compliance check from the main brain.
